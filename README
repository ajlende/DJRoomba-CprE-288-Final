ADDING, COMMITTING, PUSHING

1) Update local files in branch with 'git fetch'

2) Once in desired directory, 'git add [file name]' to add file.  only needed to be done once per file

3) 'git commit -m [message]' to commit changes to the local repository

4) 'git push origin [branch]' pushes all commits to the branch on the server

5) Once ready to add everything in your branch to the final project, submit a Merge Request via the Merge Requests Tab in GitLab


USING BRANCHES

Branches have been created for the MatLab and iRobot portions of the project. Each person should then create their own
branch off of that.

1) On the local machine, 'git branch [branch name]' to create the branch.

2) 'git checkout [branch name]' to switch to the branch you are working on.

3) Make changes to your branch

4) 'git add [file name]' to tell git to track the file

5) 'git commit -m [message]' to commit the changes

6) 'git push origin [branch name]' to push your branch to the server
